# Challenge

Bidify is an online auction platform where users can buy antiques by participating in bids. Participants bid openly against one another, with each subsequent bid required to be higher than the previous bid and the minimum bid amount. Participants have the option to configure an auto bidding bot and enable auto bidding on a particular item or multiple items to carry out bids in their favour whenever another user outbids them.

# Project tasks

### Home Page
The first page the user is navigated to after logging in to the system. The user can see the list of  existing antiques displayed for auction 
  
  
### Item Details Page
The Item Details page gives a brief description of the item and displays a countdown timer showing  how much time is left before the bidding is closed
  
  
### An auto-bidding feature
The ability to activate auto-bidding. The next time someone else makes a bid on the marked item, the  bot should automatically outbid them by 1.
  
  
### Auto bidding configuration page
A user can configure a maximum amount and a percentage threshold, i.e., a percentage of the  maximum amount at which, auto-bidding stops, and a notification alert 		 is sent to the user.
